### Amazon Translate:
Neural machine translation service for real-time, high-quality language translation.
Supports multilingual websites, apps, and content.

### Amazon Lex:
Build conversational interfaces (chatbots) using the same deep learning as Alexa.
Supports voice and text input with natural language understanding (NLU).

### Amazon Comprehend:
Natural language processing (NLP) service to extract meaning from text (e.g., sentiment, key phrases, entities).
Useful for document classification, customer feedback analysis, and search enhancement.

### Amazon Comprehend Medical:
Specialized NLP service to extract medical information from unstructured clinical text.
Helps healthcare providers and researchers process large volumes of health data.

### Amazon SageMaker:
Fully managed ML service to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale.
Supports Jupyter notebooks, built-in algorithms, model tuning, and inference endpoints.

### Amazon Forecast:
Time-series forecasting service built on machine learning.
Used for demand planning, inventory, and financial forecasting with minimal ML experience.

### Amazon Kendra:
Intelligent enterprise search service that uses natural language to search across internal documents.
Improves employee productivity by enabling smarter data discovery.

### Amazon Personalize:
ML service for building real-time personalized recommendations, similar to what Amazon.com uses.

### Amazon Textract:
Automatically extracts text, forms, and tables from scanned documents and PDFs.
Goes beyond simple OCR by preserving layout and structure.

### High Availability: 
Designing systems to be resilient to failures and ensure continuous operations.
Achieved using Multi-AZ deployments, load balancing, Auto Scaling, and fault-tolerant services like S3 and DynamoDB.

### Scalability: 
Ability to grow or shrink resources dynamically based on demand.

### Vertical scaling: 
Increasing instance size.

### Horizontal scaling: 
Adding/removing instances (e.g., EC2 + Auto Scaling Group).

### Cost Optimization: 
Managing resources efficiently to reduce AWS spending without compromising performance.
Use pricing models like Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, and services like S3 Intelligent Tiering or Compute Savings Plans.

### High Computing: 
For workloads requiring intensive CPU, memory, or GPU (e.g., machine learning, HPC, rendering).

### Connection Draining: 
Allows an Elastic Load Balancer to stop sending new requests to an EC2 instance while keeping existing connections alive until they finish.

### Synchronous Communication: 
The client sends a request and waits for the response before continuing.

### Asynchronous Communication: 
The client sends a request and proceeds without waiting for a response.
